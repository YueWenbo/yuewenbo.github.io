# Soil decomposition research proposal

I spent a semester to learn how to develop a whole research project. The whole grant proposal was consist of three components and each component was done separately. The proposal is involved in a shared soil research facility, the [DroughtNet](https://drought-net.colostate.edu) rainout shelter. The shelter decrease rainfall to the covered ground to create a extreme drought condition to simulate drought event. 

The project was designed to measure the soil decomposition rate of organic matters in subalpine region, thus the decomposition rate of the soil in drought condition. One of the advantage of this project is cheap. The material used in the proposed project include wood stick (tongue depressor), tea leaf and mesh bags. All materials are commercial available and easy to buy and duplicate.

The method proposed to use in this project is Tea Bag Index method (Keuskamp *et al.*, 2013), which use standardized material to calculate the soil decomposition rate. As the method is standardized, it is easy to compare different decomposition rates together. Also, as the material is cheap, it is easy to make large number of set to get more convincing results.

In this project, not only drought condition were designed to measure, but also fire damage was included. Among the four locations chosen, two of them were burnt in the 2019-2020 Canberra bushfire. It is known that fire causes huge damage to the soil environment, we were interested in how fire (burnt condition) effect soil decomposition. This simple method and project can measure and compare fire effect, drought effect and the interactive effect of drought and fire (show in the below figure).

The most important value of this project is cheap. It use a very limited range of material and use a pre-builded facility to determine a critical topic ---- how will the mountains react to the climate change in terms of carbon emmision. Soil decomposition rate is colsely related to the carbon emission of the mountain. Mountains contain a large amount of carbon, which has significnat impact to the whole carbon cycle. This is the siginificance of this project. 

The choice of locations and build of facility is none of my business, I have to develop this proposal with a very limited of variations and choices, but I managed to compose a complete and feasible plan and analysis method. Before this project, I barely know (only basic knowledge) soil ecology. I started to know the area in August 2020 and fully prepared to commence the project, but things didn't work out. 

From this valuable experience I learnt how to quickly get to know and familiar with a new research area, or in a bigger picture, how to start learning in  a new subject. During this time period, I experienced so many up and downs, I doubt myself and also fell confident, but finally I learnt how to face the rough time.
