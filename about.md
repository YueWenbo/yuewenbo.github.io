## My goal

I am a master graduate at ANU. I finished my master degree in year 2021, and now I am working as a research assistant in ANU for the extension of my master project. 

It is commonly know that a ordinary master student like me can't make much valuable findings in a one year master project. The most important goal I would like to accomplish in this year is to make myself fully prepared for future research. In undergraduate period, the majority things I did is learning and writing assignments. It was a passive learning. From the first year postgraduate coursework I noticed that doing research is not like that, it requires a skill of discover, to use what you don't know to find what you what to know, which means that passive learning is far from satisfactory. 

This 'blog' (or archive) is used to record my thoughts from daily learning and reading. Many thoughts were lost in time as I didn't write them down when they appeared. The reason is that I didn't think my writing is sufficient enough to clearly establish those thoughts. In my opinion, ideas are valuable, sometimes even more valuable than actual findings, because you can not find anything if you don't have an idea to start with.

This year is a fresh start for me. I am thirst for new knowledge and want to know what ideas can I generate. 

This blog is a milestone.
