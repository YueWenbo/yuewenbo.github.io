# The purpose of virus

Tumour inducing virus may face more selection pressure during the development in the early stage. They rely on the high reproduction speed of host cell by inducing the expression of proto-oncogene.

The purpose of gene is to replicate itself and get more variants along the way. Virus is a successful and 'strange' model to perform this purpose. Regular organism carry gene content in cells, the replication of gene relys on the living of the organism, e.g. animals need to 'live' to carry the gene and pass them to offsprings. This process is costly an in-efficient. 

The aim of the virus is not killing the host of defect host function, but to use host cell as a medium to reproduce virus itself. During the process, with the aid of the high mutation rate giving by the genome structure and other feature, they result in getting more and more genetic diversity. For example, influenza virus. 

In the evolution of virus, they infected millions of cells in so many species, meeting different environment or immune systems which have different selection pressure, so they evolve into different mechanisms to suit the host. As a result, the diversity of virus is made.
