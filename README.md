# README

This github page is used to show my academic path since undergraduate study. It includes a [complete CV](), a  list of articles generated from everyday thoughts (a blog, more likely) and (will include) future synthesis from reading and learning. 

The theme of this blog is designed with no theme. The design language is 'simple'. Only essential text content and link between pages are used. All pages are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and simpley deployed in Github repository. 

> A guide of how to deploy GitHub pages can be found [here](https://pages.github.com).

This page has no forward/back buttons, because it is complex. Please use the forward/back button in your web browser.
