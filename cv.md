## ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE

<u>Feb 2016 - Sept 2019</u> Finished Bachelor degree in Biotechnology, with two minor degrees in **Finance** and **economics/business**. 

[*Course taken*](courses.md)

- Gain knowledge in molecular gene techniques
- Gain knowledge in immunity and cancer
- Gain knowledge in Bacteria and bacterial populations
- Gain knowledge in computational biology and genetics
- (and more..)

<u>Aug 2020 - Sept 2020</u> Developed a complete research proposal of a [soil decomposition project](independent_page/soil_project.md)

- The aim of the proposed research is to determine the effect of drought and fire damage on soil decomposition of organic carbon.
- The value of this research is:
  - Cheap - the cost of the material used in the project is perfectly low.
  - Using a shared available facility
  - Easy to turn into a long term, wide range decomposition study
- Gain experience in quick learning and get familiar with a whole new field

<u>Feb 2021 - Nov 2021</u> Finished a project
